The monument stands in a very important place in terms of illuminating the history of Phrygia. The Midas Monument is an important place for history, and it has received little attention until the 19th century. The first great information about the historical monument that attracted the attention of a British officer in this century was obtained about half a century later.
    By examining the writings on the Midas Memorial, it is understood that it is a history dating back to the 550th century BC. The research shows that the first settlement in the region dates back to 3000 BC. The area is considered a sanctuary for a very long time starting from the first settlement. The Phrygians who dominated the region reached the peak of their art during the famous King Midas period and gave their works with a unique artistic understanding.hat's why it would be good to get it from the places where real masters work instead of doing it at home for a good meal.
